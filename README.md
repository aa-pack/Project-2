### Project Goal:
By analyzing 13F filings over the past several years, we will build a model based on fund performance to recommend an optimized combination of investment sector weightings to create a portfolio that will outperform the S&P 500â€™s annual return.

### Project Questions:
- The kind of data or subject area you will use
  -	Form 13F is a quarterly report filed, per United States Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, by "institutional investment managers" with control over $100M in assets to the SEC, listing all equity assets under management
  -	Index ETFs for the S&P 500 sectors

- The kinds of questions you will ask of the data
  -	Identify top performing funds
  -	Identify investment sector weightings for top performing funds
  -	What are the most common terms/names mentioned within each investment sector
  
- One or more data sources that will meet your requirements
