# TEAM 1 - PROJECT #2 #
## Day 3 deliverables ##

**Members:**

- Connor Gross
- Julas Hollie
- Marcus Kim
- Aaron Packard


**Group Goal:**

Analyze 13F filings over the past several years, we will build a model based on fund performance and sector weightings to outperform the S&P 500

**Original Project Questions:**

- Identify top performing funds
- Identify investment sector weightings for top performing funds
- Create model to predict sector weightings for maximum annual return
- Using sector ETFs combined using suggested sector weightings, compare quarterly and annual returns versus S&P 50


**Proposed revisions and/or additions:**

- We are dropping the first two questions: 1) Identify top performing funds; 2) Identify investment sector weightings for top performing funds.  This analysis will still be completed as part of the overall evaluation.

- We are adding the analysis of comparing these top producing hedge funds to determine their sector weightings on a quarterly basis.  How do these weightings compare across the different funds?


- We are going to consider using another library, CVXPY, as suggested in class on 08/17.
